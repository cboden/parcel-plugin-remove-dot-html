# parcel-plugin-remove-index-html
> Remove `index.html` from internal links in Parcel's build output.

[Parcel][parcel] is great, but unfortunately the HTML build output will include a trailing `index.html` for internal links. This plugin will remove `index.html` from `<a>` and `<link>` tags using [PostHTML][posthtml], making your URLs beautiful again. External URLs not part of your Parcel build will be left untouched.

## Examples
Things this plugin will replace:
* `<a href="/contact/index.html">` to `<a href="/contact/">`.
* `<link href="/contact/index.html" rel="canonical" />` to `<link href="/contact/" rel="canonical" />`.
* `<a href="http://local.dev/contact/index.html">` to `<a href="http://local.dev/contact/">` if using Parcel's `--public-url http://local.dev` flag.

Things this plugin will not replace:
* `<a href="https://www.example.com/index.html">`
* `<p>This is a sample text mentioning index.html</p>`

## Installation
Depending on which package manager you use, either:
* `$ npm install --save-dev parcel-plugin-remove-index-html`
* `$ yarn add --dev parcel-plugin-remove-index-html`

## Usage
Parcel automatically picks up on this plugin, and no further action is required on your part.

You can see how many occurrences are removed per HTML asset by enabling debug mode: `$ DEBUG=parcel:remove-index-html parcel ...`.

## Related
* [parcel-plugin-strip-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-plugin-strip-index-html): removes `index.html` from the entire source (i.e. not only `<a>` and `<link>` tags) using string replacement. This plugin will replace things you might not expect (see above).
